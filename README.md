This is a collection of musing by Cynthia Solomon on the history of
the Logo programming language. This content was originally hosted on
[WikiSpaces](https://logothings.wikispaces.com/), but that site is in
the process of being shutdown. Walter Bender migrated the content to
Markdown and posted it here.
