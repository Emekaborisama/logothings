# Marvin Minsky on Education

## Children, Learning, and Computation:

What are the possibilities for children’s intellectual growth when
every child has a computer?

In the essays included here, Marvin Minsky shares his wisdom about
children, learning, school and computation.

Five of the essays were written for OLPC ( One Laptop Per Child
Foundation). The sixth essay was written as a preface to LogoWorks, a
book of challenging Logo projects.

Marvin Minsky points out that:

Computer Science is not only about computers themselves; more
generally, it provides us with a whole new world of ways to understand
complex processes—including the ones that go on in our own mind. For
until those new techniques arrived (such as programming languages for
describing processes, and data structures for representing knowledge),
we had no expressions that people could use to articulate—and then
communicate—good new ideas about such things.

Minsky is known world wide as a co-founder of the field of Artificial
Intelligence. His books, *The Society of Mind* and *The Emotion
Machine*, have provided new insights into how the mind works and how
machines can be given commonsense reasoning.
