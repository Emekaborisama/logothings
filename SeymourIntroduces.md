# An Introduction to Logo and Turtle Geometry

This is a glimpse of Seymour introducing Logo and Turtle Geometry. The
videos were taken from Seymour Papert on Logo a video series made by
William and Elizabeth Schwartz, Ladue, Missouri.

Although these videos were made in 1986 it could have been 1970 or
today.
