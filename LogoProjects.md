# Welcome, Logo Friends.

The programs written for these projects run in MicroWorlds EX (or EX
Robotics) and PyoLogo. But I hope I've written them so that they are
easily adapted for other versions of Logo.

Some of the programs were written in different versions of
Logo. Converting them has often been "hard fun".

I've used text, graphics and video in the explanations. I plan on
adding more projects and welcome contributions from you.  --Cynthia
